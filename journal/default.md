Hi. Welcome to Journal :).

Plz read this guide.

I beg of you.

It’s 5 min max.

My name is Ali.

TBD

I will tell you how to use it.

Basically

1. Think of a topic to write about (ex. a breakup, a struggle at work, a new idea)
2. Click fullscreen
3. Click the timer
4. Start writing. No backspaces allowed. Don’t stop writing.

Once the timer is done, it’ll fade back in — and you’ll know to stop.

5. Then click reflect.

Some basic rules:

- Again, no backspaces
- No fixing spelling
- Little 5–10s breaks are fine, but try to not stop typing
- No need to stay on the topic you started with — let your mind wander
- No judgment — trust your mind!

It’s like your brain is GPT and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you’ll likely feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

This little is how I plan, prioritize and reflect on my days for many years. And in the last 6 months, with ChatGPT.

You’d be surprised how easy it is to get sucked into nonsense right when the day starts — and then end up getting nothing of real value done over the next 8–12 hours.

Often after this planning session, I’m 100x more clear and excited about what I’m about to do — and I usually end up changing what I originally planned, for the better.

If you don’t wanna write about work, other starting prompts I use for myself:

- “Today, X happened. And it’s got me feeling really down. I think — ”
- “I had a new idea around Z today and want to think through it. Basically — ”
- “I’m in love. And I just wanna talk about it. So — ”
- “I think I wanna pivot some stuff. Here’s how I’m thinking about it — ”

The starting prompt is everything. So, think on it.

Some people are better at writing about emotions.
Some are better at writing about work or ideas.

Try everything. See what works for you.

Freewriting is the most important skill I picked up in the last 10 years.

It’s helped me think through my most difficult life decisions.
It’s helped me think through startups in a more thorough way.
It’s made me a better partner and friend (I like communicating with letters).
It’s helped me be happier (on my down days, I write it all out and feel better).

So that’s it! That’s the app. I hope it helps you.

I know it’s a dumb little app — just a text view with some black text + a timer — but, use its ideas properly and it can make a big impact :).

(Or it ends up being dumb and useless for you haha. Find out for yourself!)

Lil bonus features:

1. you can keep typing and keep chatting with your reflection

2. Try to scroll on the timer using your trackpad — this is how you set different timer.

Maybe start with 5m or 10m if 15m feels like a lot. For longer sessions where I’m writing scripts or brainstorming, I do 25m.

3. There is no spellcheck. There is no markdown. This is on purpose. It doesn’t matter.

4. I’ve always felt that the font and size should reflect the mood of my writing. I’m kinda weird like that. But maybe there are other weird people like me out there haha.

For example, for more emotional entries I like a larger “24px Lato”.
If I’m thinking through a new business idea, I prefer a more official-looking “18px Serif”. I also added the random button to help you find the vibe you’re looking for.

5. Click the bar on the bottom left to see your history. It’s all saved locally. Click the file path at the top to open it in Finder.
6. Click on the settings wheel in the history toggle. Click Reflections. Click Run now on any of them. it'll reflect on your last week/month/whatever
