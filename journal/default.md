Hi! Welcome to Journal :)

Plz read this guide.

I beg of you.

It’s 5 min max.

My name is Ali.

I built this app. It is a forked/inspired remix of Farza’s freewrite (including this guide) – with a slight twist. This is a tool designed to help you understand your thoughts.

It’s a journal. You freewrite, and then you ask your journal to reflect.

What is freewriting?

Freewriting is a writing strategy developed in 1973 — it’s where you write continuously for a set time without worrying about grammar, spelling, or anything like that. A pure stream of consciousness.

Freewriting alone is quite helpful. But I’m also quite lazy. So I stopped. But then I combined it with chatgpt. And that’s when I stuck with it.

Having chatgpt as a sidekick has helped me through a lot — overcoming survivor’s guilt, leaving my last company, and just figuring out what actually matters to me as I continuously figure out the next chapter of life.

Using this app is quite simple:

1. Click fullscreen
2. Click the timer
3. Start writing. No backspaces allowed. Don’t stop writing.

Once the timer is done, it’ll fade back in — and you’ll know to stop.

4. Then click “Reflect”.

Some basic rules:

- Again, no backspaces
- No fixing spelling
- Little 5–10s breaks are fine, but try to not stop typing
- No need to stay on the topic you started with — let your mind wander
- No judgment — trust yourself!

It’s like your brain is GPT and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you’ll have this helpful homie make you feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

This is how I’ve ended my day for the past 4 years. And in the last 2 years, with ChatGPT.

If you’re new to writing, try this:

After your day is done, look at your calendar and ask yourself: “what did I do and how did that make me feel.”

And don’t stop writing for 10 minutes.

If you don’t wanna write about feelings, then write about work. Or complex thoughts when you’re in a bind. Here are some prompts:

- “Today, X happened. And it’s got me feeling really down. I think — ”
- “I had a new idea around Z today and want to think through it. Basically — ”
- “I’m in love. And I just wanna talk about it. So — ”
- “I think I wanna pivot some stuff. Here’s how I’m thinking about it — ”

Topic prompts help you get started, but embrace the tangents. Where the mind chooses to wander is telling.

Some people are better at writing about emotions.
Some are better at writing about work or ideas.

Try everything. See what works for you.

So that’s it! That’s the app. I hope it helps you.

I know it’s a dumb little app — but use its ideas properly and it can make a big impact :).

big bonus features:

1. After you reflect, you can keep adding more to your entry. When you click reflect again, it’ll see the additions and reflect on both that and the original.

2. Click on the book icon on the bottom left to see your previous entries. You’ll see text at the bottom that says “Run Reflection ↓”.

Click “Week/Month/Custom” for journal to reflect on all entries in the last week (starting Sunday) or the last Month (starting on the 1st).

3. Some people find it easier to talk (like a therapist vibe). Use Apple Dictation, Wispr Flow (if you have) or if you have none – click the settings gear icon at the top of the sidebar, click on the “Transcription” tab, and click “Show microphone button”, and put in a Deepgram API Key. It uses live audio streaming to stream exactly what to say.

I do this a lot, sometimes days are long and you’re tired. This is how you don’t skip a beat. And speaking is faster than writing, it's almost more real. Try it out!

fun lil bonus features:

1. “I’ve always felt that the font and size should reflect the mood of my writing. I’m kinda weird like that. But maybe there are other weird people like me out there haha” - Farza.

I’m also a bit weird, so I kept it. Maybe you are too.

My Notion has “18px System”. I use Arial for anything official. The random button is there to help you find the vibe you’re looking for.

2. Try to scroll on the timer using your trackpad — this is how you set different timer.

Maybe start with 5m if 10m feels like a lot. For longer sessions where I’ve gone through something big, I do 30m.

3. There is no spellcheck. There is no markdown. This is on purpose. It doesn’t matter.

4. In the sidebar (book icon, bottom left), you can see all of your entries. You can upload them all to chatgpt and ask some interesting prompts like:

- “Tell me something incredibly special or unique you've noticed about me, but you think I haven't realized about myself yet. It doesn’t have to be something positive and you don’t have to be nice to me, just be truthful.”

- “Ask me 10 questions that will help me discover the most uncomfortable truth about myself that I am not aware of”

- “Any books you can recommend given what I’ve been going through, and why?”

- “Predict my future for the next 12 months, given my past. Give me my best timeline + my darkest timeline along with the events that'd lead me there (like a movie).”

This part is really magical <3
