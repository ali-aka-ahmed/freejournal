Hi! Welcome to Journal :)

Plz read this guide.

I beg of you.

It’s 5 min max.

My name is Ali.

I built this app. It is a forked/inspired remix of Farza’s freewrite (lots from this guide included) – with a slight twist.

This is a tool designed to help you understand your thoughts.

It’s a journal. You freewrite, and then you ask your journal to reflect.

What is freewriting?

Freewriting is a writing strategy developed in 1973 — it’s where you write continuously for a set time without worrying about grammar, spelling, or anything like that. A pure stream of consciousness.

It’s quite helpful. But I’m also quite lazy. So I stopped. It's tough to deconstruct your own thoughts after you just put in the effort to dump them on the page.

But then I combined it with ChatGPT, using the same system prompt (baked into this app) to reflect back on my ramblings.

And it’s led to real breakthroughs — overcoming survivor’s guilt, leaving my last company, and just knowing what actually matters to me as I continuously figure out the next chapter of life.

Using this app is quite simple:

1. Click fullscreen
2. Click the timer
3. Start writing. No backspaces allowed. Don’t stop writing.

Once the timer is done, it’ll fade back in — and you’ll know to stop.

4. Then click “Reflect”.

Some basic rules:

- Again, no backspaces
- No fixing spelling
- Little 5–10s breaks are fine, but try to not stop typing
- No need to stay on the topic you started with — let your mind wander
- No judgment — trust yourself!

It’s like your brain is GPT and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you’ll have this helpful homie make you feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

This is how I’ve ended my day for the past 4 years. And in the last 2 years, with ChatGPT.

If you’re new to writing, try this:

After your day is done, look at your calendar and ask yourself: “what did I do and how did that make me feel.” Go chronologically.

And don’t stop writing for 10 minutes.

You’ll find you remember something that irked you. Or something that you expected and didn’t get. Embrace those tangents. Where the mind chooses to wander is telling.

If you don’t wanna write about feelings, then write about work. Or complex thoughts when you’re in a bind. Here are some prompts from Farza:

- “Today, X happened. And it’s got me feeling really down. I think — ”
- “I had a new idea around Z today and want to think through it. Basically — ”
- “I’m in love. And I just wanna talk about it. So — ”
- “I think I wanna pivot some stuff. Here’s how I’m thinking about it — ”

Some people are better at writing about emotions.
Some are better at writing about work or ideas.

Try everything. See what works for you.

After a week of using it, you get the real magic. The absolute kicker:

1. Click the book icon on the bottom left to open the sidebar
2. Click  “Week” under “Run Reflection ↓”

Your journal will read all of your entries since the last Sunday and reflect on them. It’ll pick up on patterns that you might miss.

This has really been a gamechanger. When I want to know how I was feeling for a certain period my life (like grad school) I reflect on just the entries from that period.

And now you can do that here!

Freewriting is really really helpful when you’re in a bind. In startups, I do it at least once a week. When I really have no idea what I’m doing this is how I start my day  (so almost everyday in the earliest of stages).

So that’s it! That’s the app. I hope it helps you.

I know it’s a dumb little app — but use its ideas properly and it can make a big impact :).

Big bonus features:

1. After you reflect, you can keep adding more to your entry. When you click reflect again using everything – even with weekly/monthly/custom reflections

2. Some people find it easier to talk (like a therapist vibe).

If you don’t have a speech-to-text thing like Wispr Flow – click the settings gear icon at the top of the sidebar, click on the “Transcription” tab, and click “Show microphone button”. It uses live audio streaming to stream exactly what to say.

I do this a lot, sometimes days are long and you’re tired. This is how you don’t skip a beat. And speaking is faster than writing, it's almost more real. Try it out!

PS if that doesn’t work just use Apple dictation

Lil bonus features:

1. “I’ve always felt that the font and size should reflect the mood of my writing. I’m kinda weird like that. But maybe there are other weird people like me out there haha” - Farza.

I’m also a bit weird, so I kept it. Maybe you are too.

My Notion has “18px System”. I use Arial for anything official. The random button is there to help you find the vibe you’re looking for.

2. Try to scroll on the timer using your trackpad — this is how you set different timer.

Maybe start with 5m if 10m feels like a lot. For longer sessions where I’ve gone through something big, I do 30m.

3. There is no spellcheck. There is no markdown. This is on purpose. It doesn’t matter.

4. In the sidebar (book icon, bottom left), you can click the name Journal and see a folder containing all of your entires. You can upload them all to chatgpt and ask some interesting prompts like:

- “Tell me something incredibly special or unique you've noticed about me, but you think I haven't realized about myself yet. It doesn’t have to be something positive and you don’t have to be nice to me, just be truthful.”

- “Ask me 10 questions that will help me discover the most uncomfortable truth about myself that I am not aware of”

- “Any books you can recommend given what I’ve been going through, and why?”

- “Predict my future for the next 12 months, given my past. Give me my best timeline + my darkest timeline along with the events that'd lead me there (like a movie).”

This part is also really magical <3 and a hack for features unpublished.
